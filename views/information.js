<div class="info"><h2>Who We Are</h2></div>
    <p>Founded in 2024, we are a group of hard-working foodies that found ourselves too busy during the day to make our own wings,
       and also hungry too late at night to go somewhere.
       We therefore created a simple solution: A kitchen for making the tastiest fried chicken wings in the area,
       a team of delivery drivers,
       and a mobile application that allows customers to order what they'd like efficiently with as little interaction as possible.
       With heaps of success, now you can try our competitive recipes in 3 clicks or less, until as late as 4am!</p>
